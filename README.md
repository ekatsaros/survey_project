# Survey API
API to create and manage Surveys written in Django Rest Framework

## Descritpion and Design

This api can be used to create and manage Surveys. Surveys can be assigned to specific users as well as groups or both. 
Surveys have publication and expiration date to control the display duration allong with an interval to define the frequency of the survey display.
Surveys have also different categories that each Survey belongs to. Finally there is a rating system available and can be used as star rating for example.
Different questions and types of questions can be added to the survey.
